Here are the planned characters:

- Some quantity of the [Fairfax HD](https://www.kreativekorp.com/software/fonts/fairfaxhd/) private use area
- Some more `Latin ` blocks
- Finishing the `Symbols for Legacy Computing` block

And finally, here are the unplanned* characters:

- Uncommon languages and their characters


*I these may be added later, but please don't ask for them.

# Final Notes

This font was made with KreativeKorp's Bits'n'Picas.

88int hopes to have ligiture support but doesn't know how to do that or how to keep it monospaced and do that.
